The Building Blocks are
1) Spring Boot Starter Projects
2) Spring Boot Starter Parent
3) Auto Configuration.

Spring Boot Starter Projects
Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your applications.
We get one-stop-shop for all the spring and related to technology that you need without  having to hunt  through sample code and copy paste loads dependency descriptors

For example:
spring-boot-starter-web-services build applications exposing SOAP web services

2) Spring Boot Starter Parent
All springboots projects typically use spring-boot-starter-parent as the parent in pom.xml
<parent>
<groupid>org.springframework.boot</gropuid>
<artifactid>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactid>
<version>2.0.0 RELEASE</version>
</parent>

Parent POM allows  you to manage  the following things for multiple child property and modules
1)Configuration: Java version and other properties
2)Dependency Management:Version of dependencies
3)Default plugin Configuration
